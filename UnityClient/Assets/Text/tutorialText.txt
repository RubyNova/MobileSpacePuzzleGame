Welcome to the control room captain. 

Our shields have been broken and now we face an assault on the inside of our ship!

Our only hope is to repel the invaders by activating our defence turrets to fight them back.

Our ship's mainframe is down, so we cannot do this automatically.

The only way we can activate our turrets is to manually activate them through our security camera protocols.

Before our enemies attack, I will give you a quick reminder of how to access these defences.

This is the control room, from here we can access the main camera inside any of our ships' rooms.

You will need to access a security camera in one of the rooms to be able to place the turrets.

To do this, tap on the screens in front of you - press the middle screen now.

You can look around by moving your phone around.

You can also swipe to look as well as pinch to zoom in and out.

You are now looking through a security camera. From here you can look around the room as well as activate a turret. 

To activate a turret, simply click on the turret base.

You can also change to any security camera that you see throughout the ship. To continue click on the security camera.

You can return to the control room at any time by clicking on the control room button on the bottom left of your screen.

The enemies are preparing their assualt! Best get ready to defend your ship captain.
